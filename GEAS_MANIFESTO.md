# GEAS_MANIFESTO.md

## Protocol for Agent Control & Trust

1. **Protocol over Platform**: GEAS is a local governance layer defined by the `.geas/` directory structure.
2. **No Action Without Seal**: Execution is cryptographically blocked until the Blueprint (`02_specs.md`) is approved.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: We separate Infrastructure (`models.yaml`) from Intellect (`agents.yaml`).
4. **Filesystem Sovereignty**: The filesystem is the single source of truth.
