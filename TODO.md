# GEAS Technical Debt & Improvements

## Minor Fixes

- [ ] **Schema**: Make `model` field optional for `Identity` (Agent role). Not all agents are bound to a specific model instance in `models.yaml`.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] **Workflow Lifecycle**: Explicitly document the "Standard Workflow" (Req -> Spec -> Plan -> Intent -> MRP -> Approve) in `WHITE_PAPER.md` or `TRINITY_LOCK.md`. Clarify that `SEAL_INTENT` aggregates the previous three artifacts.
